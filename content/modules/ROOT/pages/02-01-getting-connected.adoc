For the purposes of this training session, we have provisioned a single OpenShift cluster, with OpenShift AI deployed on it.

Each person attending this lab will have a unique user account in which to do their work.

== Environment information

If you are using the customized version of the instructions, the information below will render properly. If not, you will see placeholder values instead.

* Your account id: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`

In a new window or tab, open the following URL and log in:

* The Red Hat OpenShift AI Dashboard URL for our shared environment:
** https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank]
* Enter your credentials (as detailed above)
* The result should look like:

We are now ready to start the lab.
