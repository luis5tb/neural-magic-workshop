== Launch a Pipeline

The next is an example of how to launch a pipeline in the configured pipeline server.

IMPORTANT: Do not trigger the run. This is just for documentation purposes, the pipeline to be triggerd will be generated on section 5.

* Once the Data Connection and Pipeline Server are fully created, you could import pipelines

* And upload the `test_pipeline.yaml` file
+
NOTE: This file is in `neural-magic-workshop/lab-materials/02` folder; you can clone the repo or download the file from it so that you can upload it here.
