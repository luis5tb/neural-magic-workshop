= Deploy and Test the Optimized Model

== Deploy the Optimized Model

Now that we have the optimized models on the MinIO S3 bucket, lets deploy one of them.

To deploy a model you need to go to the created Data Science Project (`{user}`) and:

* Go to **Models** and click on **Deploy model**

+
NOTE: Once single-model option has been selected for the Data Science project, there is no need to select that again, it gets annotated on the `namespace`.
* And fill the form with the required information:
** Name: `optimized`
** Serving runtime: `vLLM ServingRuntime for KServe`
** Model server size: `Small`
** Accelerator: `NVIDIA GPU`
** Model route: select option to make model available through external route
** Token authentication: select `Require token authetication` and leave the default **Service account name**
** Existing connection:
*** Connection: `Minio - models`
*** Path: `granite-int4` (you can choose also `granite-int8` or `granite-fp8`)
* Click on **Deploy** and wait for the model to be ready

== Test the Optimized Model

Now that the optimized model is deployed, you can test it by sending a request to the model, and also checking the faster response time.

=== Environment Setup

. In your already cloned repository ({git-clone-repo-url}) in your laptop, go to the folder with the lab material for this section (`neural-magic-workshop/lab-materials/04`)
. Update the following variables in `request.py`:
+
[source,python]
----
MODEL = "your-model-name"  // Replace with your model name
URL = "your-api-url"       // Replace with your API endpoint
API_KEY = "your-api-key"   // Replace with your API key
----

To get the information from the deployed model to fill up those vars, you should use:

* The Model name (`optimized`) for the `MODEL`
* Copy the `token` for the `API_KEY`
* Check the `internal and external endpoints details` of the deployed model for the `URL`. Use the **external endpoint**.

=== Installation Steps

. Activate the previously created Python virtual environment -- if not already active:
+  
[source,bash]
----
source venv/bin/activate
----

. Install the required dependency -- if not already installed in the virtual env:
+
[source,bash]
----
pip install langchain_openai
----

=== Running the Script

To run the script and measure execution time:
[source,bash]
----
time python request.py
----

This will execute the script and display:

* The script's output
* Real time (wall clock time)
* User CPU time
* System CPU time

=== Remove model

To remove the model simply click on the **Delete** on the **Models** tab

IMPORTANT: You need to remove the model before going to the next step in order to have enough GPUs.
